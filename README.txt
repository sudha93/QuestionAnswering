This is a code for Question Answering. I'm training an RNN attention model for question 
similarity. Quora duolicate question dataset is used for this task. I'm using this network to get the question encodings for all the questions.
When a new question is given , based on the encodings , it finds the nearest neighbour 
in the medical QA dataset and displays its answer
